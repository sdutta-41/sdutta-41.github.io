Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Department of English, University of Miami. My research interest lies in contemporary American immigrant writing, multiethnic literature, critical race and ethnic studies, and digital humanities. 

My dissertation titled, *Transcultural Mobilities and Narratives of School Space in Contemporary U.S. Immigrant Literature*, analyzes post-911 contemporary novels to rethink the conceptual meaning and impact of what it means to understand the institutionalization of diversity within spaces of lower and higher education. I examine how the rhetoric of diversity and multiculturalism poses structural limitations on the transcultural mobilities of non-white subjects in US schools, colleges and universities.

When not dabbling in academia, I love to cook Indian food with my husband, sing, paint a little, and spend hours talking to my family back in the *city of joy*, Kolkata.
