The *A-Z of Multimodal Pedagogy* website is founded at the intersections of humanities writing, research, teaching, and adapting to a new digital infrastructure that is here to stay, thanks to Covid-19. Inspired by the keywords approach in digital research from the Keywords for Caribbean project led by Dr. Kelly Baker Josephs and Dr. Roopika Risam, A-Z of Multimodal Pedagogy will be an interactive website that offers 26 keywords (A to Z) related to digital approaches to multimodal teaching.  Keywords like C- Civic Engagement, E- E-Portfolios, M- Multiliteracies and so on, have rerouted and redefined the way instructors in the field of Writing Studies taught their courses during pre-pandemic times. The larger aim of this project is to make this keywords series broadly applicable to diverse General Education courses outside the field of Writing/Composition Studies. This open access website will be initially hosted via my personal website via GitHub pages and will be available to all by August 2021.
